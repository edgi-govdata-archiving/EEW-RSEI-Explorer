# EEW RSEI Explorer

The `explorer.ipynb` notebook creates an interactive widget that can be used to "explore" the RSEI data. Users can select an RSEI table and the columns they'd like to query. The results are loaded into a pandas dataframe to be used for further analysis.

Right now, the functionality is limited to querying a single table at a time, without any constraints on the data. Future versions will include the ability to filter the data based on user-defined criteria.
